</td><td>Helping refugees purges the human soul of parsimony and selfishness. Therefore, as in the time of our Prophet (saas), those who assist refugees and place material means at their disposal today, by God's leave enjoy a strengthening of faith and maturity of moral values. Because by using all the means at their disposal for God's sake, those who help refugees show that they attach no value to any material things in the life of this world. By making all kinds of sacrifice for the comfort and ease of their brothers in faith, they free themselves of all selfish feelings in their lower selves</td></tr>

</td><td>We are living in an era in which the world is in need of peace, friendship, and solidarity more than ever. The tensions and conflicts that defined the twentieth century continue in this new century as well, and innocent people all around the world continue to suffer from them. Despite the urgent need for solidarity and cooperation, certain circles are inciting conflict, particularly conflict between the world's two greatest and deep-rooted civilizations. This issue needs to be scrutinized, as the war of civilizations that they envisage would have disastrous consequences for humanity.</td></tr>

</td><td>There can be no doubt that nothing in the world is more important than a human being’s knowing our Creator. Knowing God, Who created us, is far more important and urgent than anything else in our lives. Let us consider the first of those things He has given us that come to mind... We live in a world specially created for life, planned down to the finest detail. But we did nothing to establish that order. We contributed nothing to the subject; we neither determined the distance of the Earth from the Sun nor the way the Earth keeps on revolving … We did not think of the need for the Sun to send rays to the Earth in order to heat it, and neither did we plan the food, water and nitrogen cycles these rays would be instrumental in … </td></tr>

</td><td>This book deals with the Muslim world’s need for the establishment of a Turkish Islamic Union and its importance for world peace in the light of the political, sociological and economic facts. The current situation clearly suggests that Muslims will influence the developments of the twenty-first century in one way or another. However, what really matters here is that this influence must benefit the Islamic world in particular and humanity in general. The first thing that comes to mind at this stage is whether the Islamic world can play such a role, given its present condition. No doubt, Muslims have the necessary ability and awareness to shoulder this responsibility. </td></tr>

</td><td>Take a look around you from where you sit. You will notice that everything in the room is ‘made’: the walls, the upholstery, the ceiling, the chair where you sit, the book you hold in your hand, the glass on the table and countless other details. None of them happen to exist in your room of their own accord. Even the simple loops of the carpet were made by someone: they did not appear spontaneously or by chance. A person who is about to read a book knows that it has been written by an author for a specific reason. It would not even occur to him that this book might have come into being by chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td>October, 2006</td><td>by HARUN YAHYA</td><td><a href="https://harun-yahya.github.io/A-CHAIN-OF-MIRACLES.html" target="_blank">A CHAIN OF MIRACLES</a>
</td><td>The universe, the Milky Way galaxy that is home to our solar system, and our planet Earth are all governed by countless factors. All these laws and balances have been specifically designed and miraculously ordered to produce an environment suitable for human life. Examining our universe in detail reveals that everything —from the most fundamental cosmic laws to the most critical physical properties, from the smallest balances to the finest ratios therein— have been arranged to meet the highest level of exactness. We are astonished to realize that this precision is set at the ideal values for human existence to not only survive, but thrive. </td></tr>

</td><td>Did you know that 700,000 years ago, people were sailing the oceans in very well-constructed ships? Or have you ever heard that the people described as "primitive cavemen" possessed an artistic ability and understanding just as refined as those of modern artists? Did you know that the Neanderthals, who lived 80,000 years ago and whom evolutionists portrayed as "ape-men," made musical instruments, took pleasure from clothing and accessories, and walked over painfully hot sands with molded sandals?</td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td>October, 2007</td><td>by HARUN YAHYA</td><td><a href="https://harun-yahya.github.io/ALLAHS-ART-OF-DETAIL.html" target="_blank">ALLAH'S ART OF DETAIL</a>
</td><td>Anyone who carefully considers this world and the things that enable him to live for even a few minutes will be completely astonished. Our planet, which was specially created for life in one of the giant galaxies in the endless void of space, constantly revolves within that boundless void. The Sun, just one of the universe’s billions of stars, sends its rays to Earth within that same void. As a result, our planet is warmed; the various food, water, and nitrogen cycles occur, and human beings, animals, plants, and micro-organisms are able to survive due to the countless conditions that make their continued life possible. </td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td>October, 2015</td><td>by HARUN YAHYA</td><td><a href="https://harun-yahya.github.io/AMERICAS-FAILURE-TO-PERCEIVE-THE-PKK.html" target="_blank">AMERICA'S FAILURE TO PERCEIVE THE PKK</a>
</td><td>The PKK, which has been trying for almost 40 years to create a communist-anarchist state by breaking Turkey apart, has been trying to achieve this aim most recently through various illegal state apparatus (such as the KCK) it has set up within the country. At this stage, the Turkish State should take strong, efficient, and realistic precautions more than ever and should look out for our Kurdish brothers seriously. In this time, when the Middle East is fighting against so many disturbances, the fact that the USA is openly arming the PKK's branch in Syria (PYD) is a major problem. The American deep state dreams of a Great Kurdistan in the Middle East, largely because of some Evangelicals' incor- rect expectations about the End Times, and therefore sees no harm in sup- porting the PKK and its branches. It fails to analyze the scourge of the PKK properly and comprehend that this communist-anarchist organization poses a serious threat to itself as well. This book explains how the PKK puts its malicious designs on Turkey in- to effect, which methods it uses to get the inside track, and what precau- tions Turkey must take against it. It also offers solutions and describes the great mistake that the USA is making by supporting the PKK. </td></tr>
