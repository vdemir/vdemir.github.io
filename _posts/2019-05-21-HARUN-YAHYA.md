</td><td>Occasionally a person faces various physical and spiritual sorrows and troubles in the world. Amongst these are feelings so intense that they cannot be compared with any other physical pain. This feeling that causes such great distress in the human soul is a feeling called "regret." There are two completely different forms of regret, however. The regret felt by people of faith and the regret that non-believers experience. These two feelings are extremely different from one another.</td></tr>

</td><td>"Adopt my faith, or die!" That is the slogan of the fanatics. There is no such concept as democracy, freedom of ideas, love, respect, affection, friendship, altruism, appreciating women, scientific progress or making the world a better place in fanaticism. Some people imagine that fanaticism, and its offshoot radicalism, can settle inside a true faith. Yet fanaticism is itself a religion; there are representatives of this false religion inside every idea. There are fanatics in Islam, in Judaism and in Christianity, just as there are in Marxism, fascism and atheism. They all espouse the same false faith; "I don't like your ideas! Either go along with my ideas, or die!"</td></tr>

</td><td>Imagine you’ve just bought an immensely detailed mod- el airplane kit. How do you set about putting all the hundreds of tiny parts together? First, no doubt, you’ll examine the illustrations on the box. Then, following the instructions inside shortens the whole process of putting a model together in the best way possible, making no mistakes. Even lacking any assembly instructions, you can still manage the task if you already possess a similar model airplane. The first plane’s design can serve as an important guide in assembling any later one. In the exact same way, using a flawless design in nature as a model provides shortcuts to designing technological equipment with the same functions in the most perfect possible manner. </td></tr>

</td><td>Between early 2001 and the present day there have been a number of very interesting and important developments in the world of science. The advances made in such different scientific fields as palaeontology, molecular biology, anatomy and genetics have once again revealed the terrible scientific dilemma the theory of evolution finds itself in. The theory of evolution was proposed in its present form in the mid-19th century by Charles Darwin and at that time provided enormous support for materialism. Such was that support that the present collapse of the theory is also resulting in the collapse of materialism itself. </td></tr>

</td><td>The constant clashes, conflicts and wars that mar today's world are actually supposed to be happening now, in these End Times, as the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) told us 1,400 years ago. However, since God creates everything to be dependent on causes, the current volatile environment of our age has its own causes and the duty of the dajjal (the antichrist) is creating these causes, so that the confrontation between good and evil can take place. However, this showdown will end with the intellectual victory of the Mahdi (pbuh), who will usher in the Golden Age, a time of complete peace for our pain-stricken world. This victory will mark the defeat of dajjal, the source of evil, and start a new era of salvation for our world, which up to that point was a scene of wars and conflicts. </td></tr>
