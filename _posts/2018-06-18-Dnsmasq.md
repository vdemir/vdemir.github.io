**How to speed up the internet through caching DNS on Linux machines with Dnsmasq**
-------------

Dnsmasq is a lightweight **``DHCP and DNS caching nameserver``**. Unlike **``BIND``**, dnsmasq is incredibly simple to get up and running. The benefits of adding this will be quite obvious (like your DNS queries getting dramatically faster).

I want to walk you through the steps of installing and configuring dnsmasq.

***

## **Installation**

***

The first thing you must do is install dnsmasq.

Once that command completes, the software is installed and ready to be configured.

***

## **Configuration**

***

There are three files that must be configured. The first is ``/etc/dnsmasq.conf``. Open that file in your text editor of choice and look for the line:

~~~
#listen-address=
#resolv-file=
~~~

Change the above lines to:

~~~
listen-address=127.0.0.1
resolv-file=/etc/resolv-dnsmasq.conf
~~~

Optionally, you could increase the cache size for dnsmasq. Look for the line `#cache-size=150`. Remove the # and change the 150 to 1000 or whatever size you might need (there is a hard-limit of 10000).

Save and close the file.

Next open up the file `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`. Look for the line `supersede domain-search "example.com", "isc.org";` and make sure the following section looks exactly like this:

~~~
prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,
netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers,
dhcp6.domain-search, dhcp6.fqdn,
dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.sntp-servers;
~~~

Save and close that file.

Open up your `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` file and make sure that it includes (at least) the line:

~~~
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
dns=dnsmasq
~~~

Finally, open up your `/etc/resolv-dnsmasq.conf` file and make sure that it includes (at least) the line:

~~~
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
~~~

Optionally, you could increase the cache size for dnsmasq and change to 2048 for single machine or whatever size you might need (there is a hard-limit of ``10000``).

`echo "cache-size=2048" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/cache`

Restart the dnsmasq service with the systemd:


***

## **Run Dnsmasq with systemd**

***

Create `/etc/systemd/system/dnsmasq@.service` with these contents:

~~~bash
# '%i' becomes 'virbr10' when running
# `systemctl start dnsmasq@virbr10.service`
# Remember to run `systemctl daemon-reload`
# after creating or editing this file.


[Unit]
Description=DHCP and DNS caching server for %i.
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dnsmasq -k --conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

It is best to only start dnsmasq when the bridge is up. If using NetworkManager, create `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-virbr10` and make it executable.

~~~bash
#!/bin/sh
# See the "DISPATCHER SCRIPTS" section of `man NetworkManager`.
# Remember to make this file executable!
[ "$1" != "virbr10" ] && exit 0
case "$2" in
    "up")
        /bin/systemctl start dnsmasq@virbr10.service || :
        ;;
    "down")
        /bin/systemctl stop dnsmasq@virbr10.service || :
        ;;
esac
~~~

If using Debian, append two command options to `/etc/network/interfaces`.

~~~bash
auto virbr10
iface virbr10 inet static
    ... snipped ...
    up /bin/systemctl start dnsmasq@virbr10.service || :
    down /bin/systemctl stop dnsmasq@virbr10.service || :
~~~

Alternatively, just start dnsmasq at every boot.

~~~bash
# systemctl enable dnsmasq@virbr10.service
# systemctl start dnsmasq@virbr10.service
~~~
<br>

***

## How to avoid conflicts between dnsmasq and systemd-resolved?

***

You can edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and add this line:

~~~
DNSStubListener=no
~~~

Or,

~~~
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
~~~

***

## **Testing the improvements**

***

Testing dnsmasq is quite simple. 

~~~
$ dig www.google.com | grep "Query time"
~~~

Notice the query time of 48 msec.

Run the same command again, and you should see a considerable improvement over the query times.

We now see a ``0`` or near ``0 query time`` for the same command. When a machine is having to query a significant amount of addresses, that time savings adds up.

***

## **Vulnerabilities in the free DNS server Dnsmasq**

***

Software developers and manufacturers should bring Dnsmasq up to date for security reasons.

## **A much-needed improvement:**

***
I've used dnsmasq on a Linux machines and always found it added a much-needed improvement to networking speeds. Give this easy DHCP and DNS caching nameserver, go and see if it doesn't find your Linux machines screaming on the network.
