**Virus scanning with ClamAV**
-------------

Until this time, Linux has experienced only a small number of viruses. Some of these viruses still exist but aren't active, and they certainly don't propagate. As Linux on the desktop reaches critical mass, there's a possibility that more viruses will appear, but that may still be a long ways off. 

Linux plays a critical role in server systems. Thus, virus scanners for Linux are essential when serving e-mail or files to clients. If you can remove the viral threat before it hits the clients, those clients become safer and less prone to infection.

One open source virus scanner that deserves mentioning is ClamAV. You can plug ClamAV directly into e-mail servers, and it will scan for viruses as the e-mail arrives—before it's delivered to users' mailboxes. It also performs routine scans on files that are served up to clients via sharing.

ClamAV works as a client/server system, but you can use it as a stand-alone scanner as well. 


* * *

### **Install ClamAV From Source**

* * *

If you installed from sources, first uninstall the old version:

~~~
./configure

sudo make uninstall
~~~

Firstly, let's process A command to create a user with clamav,

Some OS's require you to add the group as well.

~~~
# groupadd clamav
# useradd clamav
~~~

***

### **Create and chown the directories**

* * *

~~~
mkdir /var/log/clamav /var/lib/clamav /var/run/clamav
touch /var/log/clamav/clamd.log /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
touch /var/run/clamav/clamd.socket
~~~

~~~
chown -R clamav:clamav /var/log/clamav /var/lib/clamav /var/run/clamav
~~~

</div>

Download the latest stable ClamAV distribution from https://www.clamav.net/downloads

Expand the distribution that include Linux Filesystem Hierarchy and cd into the resultant directory and build ClamAV using:

~~~
tar -xzf clamav-*
cd clamav*
./configure 
    --prefix=/usr \
    --sysconfdir=/etc/clamav \
    --sbindir=/usr/bin \
    --with-dbdir=/var/lib/clamav \
    --with-user=clamav \
    --with-group=clamav \
    --disable-rpath \
    --disable-clamav \
    --disable-llvm \
    --enable-zlib-vcheck \
    --disable-milter \
    --enable-clamdtop 
make
sudo make install
~~~

* * *

### **Summary of engine detection features**

* * *

~~~
              bzip2       : ok
              zlib        : /usr
              unrar       : yes
              pcre        : /usr
              libmspack   : yes (Internal)
              libxml2     : yes, from /usr
~~~

* * *

### **Modify the freshclam configuration:**

* * *

~~~
mv -fv /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
nano -w /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
~~~

Comment out the line (put a # as the first character on the line) near the top that says 

# Examplesimply:

~~~
LogSyslog yes
DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav
UpdateLogFile /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
LogFileMaxSize 2M
LogVerbose yes
PidFile /var/run/clamav/freshclam.pid
DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
DatabaseOwner clamav
DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
~~~

* * *

### **Modify the clamd configuration;**

* * *

~~~
mv -fv /etc/clamav/clamd.conf.sample /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
nano -w /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
~~~

# **Example**

~~~
LogSyslog yes
LogFile /var/log/clamav/clamd.log
LogFileMaxSize 2M
LogTime yes
LogVerbose yes
PidFile /var/run/clamav/clamd.pid
LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.socket
TCPSocket 3310
~~~

Save and close the files.

<div class='pull-right alert alert-warning' style="margin: 15px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/clamav-2.jpg" alt="programs" class="img-responsive" width="569px" height="325px"/>

</div>

* * *

### **Missing systemd service file**

* * *

We didn’t get a systemd service file, so creating a quick file here. The process should be forking itself and start freshclam in daemon mode. In this case we configure it to check 4 times a day for new files.
<br>
Create a new file /usr/lib/systemd/system/clamav-freshclam.service

* * *

### **Run the freshclam as daemon**

* * *

~~~
[Unit]
Description = freshclam scanner
After = network.target

[Service]
Type = forking
ExecStart = /usr/bin/freshclam -d -c 4
Restart = on-failure
PrivateTmp = true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~
<br>
Next step is changing the clamd service file /usr/lib/systemd/system/clamav-daemon.service
<br>
~~~
[Unit]
Description = clamd scanner daemon
After = syslog.target nss-lookup.target network.target

[Service]
Type = simple
ExecStart = /usr/bin/clamd -c /etc/clamav/clamd.conf --foreground=yes
Restart = on-failure
PrivateTmp = true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

Move into the directory.
~~~
cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
~~~

<div class='pull-right alert alert-warning' style="margin: 15px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/clamav-3.jpg" alt="programs" class="img-responsive" width="569px" height="325px"/>
  <p><small>Security &bull; ClamAv.</small></p>
</div>


* * *

### **Start all services**
---------

* * *


~~~
systemctl enable clamav-freshclam.service
systemctl enable clamav-daemon.service
systemctl start clamav-freshclam.service
systemctl start clamav-daemon.service
~~~


* * *

### **Check the status**
---------

* * *


~~~
systemctl status clam-freshclam.service
